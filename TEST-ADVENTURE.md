You're a guard for a small merchant caravan traveling through the Greenwood Forest. It's late afternoon, and you're walking alongside the lead wagon when you hear rustling in the bushes ahead.

## How to Play

Ask me to:
1. **Roll initiative** - "Roll 1d20+1 for my initiative"
2. **Make attacks** - "I attack the goblin with my longsword, roll 1d20+5"
3. **Check rules** - "What's the rule for opportunity attacks?"
4. **Resolve situations** - "Can I shove the goblin as a bonus action?"

## Using MCP Tools

During the game, I'll use:
- `roll_dice` - For all rolls
- `query_rule` - To check rules
- `resolve_edge_case` - For unusual situations

## Ready to Start?

Just say: **"Let's begin! Roll initiative for me."**

Or if you want to create your own character, just describe them and we'll start!
